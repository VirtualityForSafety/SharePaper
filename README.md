# SharePaper
SharePaper is an open-source project of a web-based paper repository for a collaborative submission.
SharePaper aims to integrate and share multiple authors' thoughts and quotes from various papers.
Two major features are given from the use of SharePaper:
- A shared paper repository (as a nature of GitHub repository)
- Easy accessibility of tracking thoughts of citation by tag
The project was initiated by [Jinki Jung](https://github.com/jinkijung), and then has been implemented by [Soyeon Kim](https://github.com/soykim314), [Sua Lee](https://github.com/otterlee), [Sangho Lee](https://github.com/kimmydkemf), and [Jinki Jung](https://github.com/jinkijung).
