**IMPORTANT: This work is further developed as PaperMining(https://github.com/JinkiJung/PaperMining). This repository will not be maintained.

SharePaper is an open-source project of a web-based reference manager for collaborative submissions.
SharePaper aims to maximizing writing productivity by two core functions:
- Share authors' intention of referencing other papers as tags
- Convert tags to latex formatted texts (+ bibtex) by organizing them into sections

The project was initiated by [Jinki Jung](https://github.com/jinkijung), and then has been implemented with [Soyeon Kim](https://github.com/soykim314), [Sua Lee](https://github.com/otterlee), and [Sangho Lee](https://github.com/kimmydkemf).

## Current setup
- Remotely (read-only): SharePaper provides a web interface to explore whole contents.
- Locally: we recommend to setup local servers and maintaining it locally, for frequent updates.

## Required

## Execute a local server
